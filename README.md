# Storie

http://storie.press

Storie is a minimalist site to write, read, and comment on stories. It is somewhere between Medium, LiveJournal, and Facebook. Storie is a single page web app built with React.js and Redux on the frontend, a PostgreSQL database, and Ruby on Rails in the backend.

## Features
* Secure sign up and login. Passwords are encrypted using BCrypt. The site keeps track of returning users logins with the help of session tokens stored in the users browser.

### Stories
Storie is text focused. It is foregoing post header images as they are often superfluous and only marginally related to the writing. No images for the sake of having an image. The same goes for likes. If they're plenty, and fast, they make us happy, if they're not, we feel undervalued. They say more about marketing than quality, and popular does not equal good.
